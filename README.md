# TCGPriceTracker
## AI-Powered Trading Card Price Intelligence Platform
This project aims to build an AI-driven price intelligence and forecasting platform for trading card games (TCGs) that provides collectors, players, and investors with transparent historical pricing, market context, and short- to medium-term price predictions.
The platform aggregates historical transaction data across major marketplaces and analyzes price behavior using time-series modeling, anomaly detection, and market-event attribution. Users can search for any card—or scan it using existing image recognition tools—and instantly view interactive price charts showing how the card’s value has evolved over time, along with AI-generated explanations for major price movements.
Rather than presenting raw prices alone, the system contextualizes market fluctuations by identifying contributing factors such as meta relevance, reprints, grading premiums, tournament results, scarcity shifts, and broader market sentiment. When users hover over spikes or drops on the price graph, they see a short, human-readable explanation describing why the price changed at that point in time.
To ensure accuracy and robustness, the platform automatically detects and adjusts for outliers—such as mispriced listings, damaged cards sold as near-mint, or one-off speculative buys—so predictions reflect true market trends rather than noise.
The end result is a cross-TCG analytics layer that transforms fragmented pricing data into actionable insight, enabling better buying, selling, grading, and long-term collecting decisions across Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, sports cards, and future collectible markets.
